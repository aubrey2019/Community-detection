# **Community Detection In Graphs**

## **Objective:**

In this project, we will implement the Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect communities in graphs where each community is a set of users who have a similar business taste, using the Yelp dataset. We will identify these communities using map-reduce, Spark RDD and standard python libraries.

## **Environment Setup:**
Python Version = 3.6

Spark Version = 2.3.3

## **Dataset:**

The dataset sample_data.csv is a sub-dataset which has been generated from the Yelp review dataset. Each line in this dataset contains a user_id and business_id.
